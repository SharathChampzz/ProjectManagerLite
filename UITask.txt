UI Task:
#1. Sign Up Page: 
    POST: /api/users/signup 
    Request Body: 
    {
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string"
    }
    Expected Result: On Successfull => Redirect to Login Page

#2. Login page:
    POST: /token
    Form Data: username and password
    Successfull Response:
    {
    "access_token": "string",
    "token_type": "string",
    "user": {
        "id": 0,
        "username": "string",
        "is_active": true,
        "is_superuser": true,
        "role": "string"
    }
    }

    Expected Behaviour: 
    Post Successfull login redirect to /issues page and store the user props efficiently like a prod env, We will need it later
    API response will also set cookies. Send it in all the upcoming requests.
    Also send Authorization header: Bearer ****. Send it in all the upcoming requests.

#3. Issues Listing Page: /issues
    #3.a : Filtering
        React grid page that lists the issues. API to fetch: /api/tasks

        Possible Filters: /api/tasks/?skip=0&limit=100&creator_name=hello&assigner_name=hello&subject_contains=hello&criticality=hello&status=hello&thread_id=hello
            
            skip: int = 0,
            limit: int = 100,
            creator_name: str = None,
            assigner_name: str = None,
            subject_contains: str = None,
            criticality: str = None,
            status: str = None,
            thread_id: str = None,

        Pagination should use skip and limit
        dropdown on grid to filter: criticality and status
        other columns should have column based filter (creator_name, assigner_name, thread_id) => The available values should be populated based on what grid currently holds and it should also show the values from next page if pagination is used.
        Search on grid should search for subject

        Supported Values for criticality and status:
        class TaskStatus(str, Enum):
            OPEN = "OPEN"
            FIXED = "FIXED"
            CLOSED = "CLOSED"
            
        class TaskCriticality(str, Enum):
            LOW = "LOW"
            MEDIUM = "MEDIUM"
            HIGH = "HIGH"
            CRITICAL = "CRITICAL"

    #3b. Links generation
        For each of the task we receive in the response. We need to build a clickable url, On clicking open the url in new tab. (/tasks/{task_id})

    #3c. Clickable restriction
        When we logged in, we have stored user properties like is_active, is_superuser. Clicks should be clickable only if user is_active

    #3d. Create task option on top of the grid. That should open up a form and handle post for the below form data
        POST /api/tasks
        FastAPI Backend Code:
        async def create_task(
            creator_name: str = Form(...),
            assigner_name: str = Form(...),
            subject: str = Form(...),
            criticality: schemas.TaskCriticality = Form(...),
            status: schemas.TaskStatus = Form(...),
            thread_id: str = Form(...),
            html_file: UploadFile = File(...),
            db: Session = Depends(dependencies.get_db)
        ):

#4. Task Details Page: API to use: GET /api/tasks/{task_id}
    Response:
        {
            "creator_name": "string",
            "assigner_name": "string",
            "subject": "string",
            "criticality": "LOW",
            "status": "OPEN",
            "html_file": "string",
            "thread_id": "string",
            "id": 0,
            "created_time": "2024-07-01T04:32:36.578Z"
        }
    
    #4a. This page should show the details of task in nice UI.

    #4b: Edits
        API to perform Edit: PUT /api/tasks/{task_id}

        View Only:
            creator_name
            created_time

        hidden:
            id (show only in url) not on page
            thread_id

        Eye View Icon:
            html_file edit is not supported and it should have view icon

        Populate Values for Edit:
            For criticality and status: Use Enum class
            For subject: Editable text on clicking edit icon
            For assigner_name: Make API call GET /api/users. Populate dropdown list with usernames. Make sure to show loading bar during fetch.
                Response:
                    [
                        {
                            "id": 0,
                            "username": "string",
                            "is_active": true,
                            "is_superuser": true,
                            "role": "string"
                        }
                    ]
        
    #4c:
        html_file is view only => On clicking view icon => send request to get html file and open dialog and show html content.
        API get GET /html/{filename} => API not implemented yet

    #4d:
        If user is_superuser (read for storage), show delete option and delete task
        API: DELETE /api/tasks/{task_id}
